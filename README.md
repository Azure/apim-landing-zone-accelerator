# Enterprise-Scale-APIM

This is a repository ([aka.ms/EnterpriseScale-APIM](https://aka.ms/EnterpriseScale-APIM)) that contains both enterprise architecture (proven recommendations and considerations) and reference implementaion (deployable artifacts for a common implementations).

## Enterprise-Scale Architecture

The enterprise architecture is broken down into six different design areas, where you can find the links to each at:
| Design Area|Considerations|Recommendations|
|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| Identity and Access Management|[Design Considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/app-platform/api-management/identity-and-access-management#design-considerations)|[Design Recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/app-platform/api-management/identity-and-access-management#design-recommendations)|

## Enterprise-Scale Reference Implementation

In this repo you will also find reference implementations with supporting Infrastructure as Code templates. More reference implementations will be added as they become available.

## Other Considerations

1. This is a way you can execute bicep deployment:

    ```azcli
    az deployment sub create --location eastus --name am --template-file main.bicep --parameters workloadName=am environment=dev
