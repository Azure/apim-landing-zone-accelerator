# Management and Monitoring
## Design Considerations
- Be aware of maximum throughput limits of each APIM SKU
- Be aware of the maximum number of scale-out units per APIM SKU
- Be aware of the maximum throughputs are approximate and not guarantees 
- Be aware of the time required to scale-out, deploy into another region, or convert from deployment types
- APIM does not scale-out automatically, additional configuration is required.
- There is no downtime during a scale-out event
- Only the gateway component of API Management is deployed to all regions in a multi-region deployment. 
- Be aware of the possible performance impact of AppInsights logging at high loads.
- Be aware that the number of inbound and outbound policies applied and their impact to performance
- Policies are code and should be under version control
- APIM's built-in cache is shared by all units in the same region in the same API Management service.
- Utilize Availability Zones, the number of Units selected must distribute evenly across the zones
- Self-hosted gateway's credentials expire every 30 days and must be rotated. 
- The Uri /status-0123456789abcdef can be used as a common health endpoint for the APIM service.
- The APIM Service is not a WAF. Deploy Azure App Gateway in front to add additional layers of protection
- Client certificate negotiation is enabled is a per-gateway configuration 
- certificates updated in the key vault are automatically rotated in API Management and is updated within 4 hours. 
- Secret in Key Vault is updated within 4 hours after being set. You can also manually refresh the secret using the Azure portal or via the management REST API.
- Custom Domains can be applied to all endpoints or just a subset. The Premium tier supports setting multiple host names for the Gateway endpoint.
- APIM can be backed up using its Management REST API. Backups expire after 30 days. Be aware of what APIM does not back up.
- Named-Keys are global in scope.
- API Operations can be grouped into Products and Subscriptions. The design will be based on actual business requirements.

## Design Recommendations 
- Apply custom domains to the Gateway endpoint only
- Use Event Hub policy for logging at high performance levels 
- Utilize an external cache for control and fastest performance 
- Deploy at least two scale units spread over two AZs per region for best availability and performance 
- Utilize Azure Monitor to Autoscale APIM. If using a self-hosted gateway, use Kubernetes Horizonal Pod Autoscaler to scale out the gateway
- Deploy self-host gateways where Azure does not have a region close to the back-end API
- Utilize Key Vault for Certificate storage, notification, and rotation
- Do not enable 3DES, TLS1.1 or lower encryption protocols unless absolutely required. 
- Utilize DevOps and Infrastructure-As-Code practices to handle all deployments, updates, and DR. 
- Create an API revision and Change Log entry for every API update.  
- Utilize Backends to eliminate redundant API backend configurations.
- Utilize Named-Values to store common values that can be used in policies.
- Utilize Key Vault to store secrets that Named-Values can reference.
- Secrets updated in the key vault are automatically rotated in API Management.
- Develop communication strategy to notify users of breaking API version update.
- Set diagnostic settings to forward AllMetrics and AllLogs to Log Analytics workspace
