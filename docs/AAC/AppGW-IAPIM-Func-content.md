## Architecture

### Workflow

The architecture consists of the following components:

- **Thing 1**. Description

- **Thing 2**. Description

### Components

> A bullet list of components in the architecture (including all relevant Azure services) with links to the product service pages. This is for lead generation (what business, marketing, and PG want). It helps drive revenue.

## Recommendations

The following recommendations apply for most scenarios. Follow these recommendations unless you have a specific requirement that overrides them.

_Include considerations for deploying or configuring the elements of this architecture._

## Scalability considerations

_Identify and address scalability concerns relevant to the architecture in this scenario._

## Availability considerations

_Identify and address availability concerns relevant to the architecture in this scenario._

## Manageability considerations

_Identify and address manageability concerns relevant to the architecture in this scenario._

## Security considerations

_Identify and address security concerns relevant to the architecture in this scenario._

## Deploy this scenario

_Describe a step-by-step process for implementing the reference architecture solution. Best practices are to add the solution to GitHub, provide a link (use boilerplate text below), and explain how to roll out the solution._

A deployment for a reference architecture that implements these recommendations and considerations is available on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/path-to-repo).
